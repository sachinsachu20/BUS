Red bus data scraping with selenium & 
Dynamic Filtering using streamlit 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

This project involves creating a web scraping tool using Selenium 
to extract bus travel data from the Red Bus website (or a similar bus 
booking website). The scraped data includes details such as bus 
names, travel times, ticket prices, available seats, and 
departure/arrival locations. This data is then made available through 
a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, where users can 
dynamically filter and search for buses based on various criteria such 
as price range, travel duration, seat availability, etc.
